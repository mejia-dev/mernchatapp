# MERN Stack Chat Application

## What is a MERN stack?
A MERN stack is comprised of the following technologies that can be used to create a full-stack web application:
- [**M**ongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [**E**xpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [**R**eactJS](https://react.dev/)
- [**N**odeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

#### Additional Technologies Used:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Description
This project provides user login / logout functionality, account creation, and real time messaging using websockets.

#### Additional features:
* Intuitive UI design.
* Autoscroll to the bottom of the page for long chats
* Status indicators for when a user is online or offline
* Easily scalable NoSQL database structure.

More information autogenerated by Vite can be found below in the "More Vite Information" section.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository by running the following command from the Git Bash console:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mejia-dev/mernchatapp.git
   ```

* Navigate to the project directory, then to the `api` subdirectory:
  ```bash
  cd mernchatapp/api
  ```

* Create a new file called `.env`:
  ```bash
  touch .env
  ```

* Create a new MongoDB database (refer to the [official documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/create-database-deployment/) if needed). 


* Add the deployment URL (starting with `mongodb+srv://`) into the `.env` file in the following format, replacing `YOUR_URL_HERE` with the url:
  ```txt
  MONGO_URL= "YOUR_URL_HERE"
  ```

* Next specify two more keys in `.env`. 
  * The JWT_SECRET must be a secret key for the JWT generation. This can be set to anything. 
  * The CLIENT_URL must be set to the the server address that connections will be made from. The default should be `http://localhost:5173`.
  ```txt
  MONGO_URL = "mongodb+srv://mernchat:slidfjalsdi@cluster0.aslidjf.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
  JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
  CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"
  ```

* Run the following command to install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

* Once the dependencies install, run the following command to start the backend API:
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

* Leave the terminal open, then start another terminal in the project directory to navigate to the `client` folder and run the start command to run the live development server:
  * ```bash
    cd mernchatapp/client
    ```
  * ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

To generate a built version of the application, use `npm run build`.

## More Vite Information:

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
